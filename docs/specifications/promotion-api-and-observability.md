# Recertia Specifications: 8. Promotion policy

## 8. Promotion policy

```text
draft      → candidate : all non-judge criteria passed during the originating run
candidate  → shadow    : task_class has an eval set with >= 5 golden tasks
shadow     → candidate : >= 10 shadow applications
                         AND lift / success thresholds (maybe_advance_shadow_to_candidate)
candidate  → approved  : golden-gated promote_to_approved (human approval is the v1 default path;
                         post-shadow eligibility still requires the same golden gate);
                         self_distilled also needs apply_diversity.distinct_apply_sessions ≥ 2
approved   → deprecated: a newer version of the same skill reaches approved
any        → quarantined: 2 consecutive field failures, or a reviewer rejection
                         (enqueues lineage revoke; Recertifier drains)
```

These are all `SkillStatus` transitions (§2.2, §2.5), made by the Curator or Recertifier reading
across runs — never by a single run's task-plane graph (§4, ADR-0008). Shadow autonomy advances
only to `candidate`; it MUST NOT write `approved`.

Regression gate: before any promotion to `approved`, the golden set for the skill's
`task_class` MUST run green against the candidate via `promote_to_approved`. A regression
blocks promotion and is reported with the failing task ids. When the candidate supersedes an
approved predecessor, the gate MUST also re-run every golden fixture that predecessor passed
(predecessor non-regression). Failing a predecessor fixture is a refusal even if the
candidate still solves its own fixture.

`promote_to_approved` writes `lifecycle=approved`. It sets `active=True` only for
`human_authored` and `mined_from_human_artifact` skills. `self_distilled` versions remain
`active=False` until contribution evidence is non-negative (bounded shadow slots gather that
evidence). The Recertifier quarantines a version after two consecutive treatment-arm field
failures where that skill was applied.

## 9. HTTP API

Versioned under `/v1`. JSON only. Auth: `X-API-Key` with scoped keys (`runs`, `blobs`, `metrics`, `admin`).

### Implemented (offline + console C0–C4 + remaining-work HTTP)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness |
| `POST` | `/v1/runs` | Execute a task via `GraphOrchestrator.start` (sync; optional `mode=async`). Body: `request` or `goal`, optional `task_class`, `criteria`, `script`, `budget`, `workdir`, `run_id`, `arm`. Quota exhaustion returns the error envelope (`budget_exhausted` / `worker_busy`). |
| `GET` | `/v1/runs` | List/filter runs (console C0) |
| `GET` | `/v1/runs/{run_id}` | Status / terminal / route log (memory + checkpoint fallback) |
| `POST` | `/v1/runs/{run_id}/resume` | Resume from last checkpoint |
| `GET` | `/v1/runs/{run_id}/transcript` | Structured transcript |
| `GET` | `/v1/runs/{run_id}/events` | SSE run event stream (console C2) |
| `POST` | `/v1/runs/{run_id}/cancel` | Cooperative cancel at next node boundary |
| `POST` | `/v1/blobs` · `GET` `/v1/blobs/{digest}` | Content-addressed blob put/get |
| `GET` | `/v1/metrics/dashboard` | Telemetry dashboard panels |
| `GET` | `/v1/metrics/report` · `/v1/metrics/canary` | Compounding metrics (yield/precision/decay or `unavailable`) and judge canary |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills` | List/filter by `task_class`, `lifecycle` |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/{skill_id}/versions/{version}` | Full skill version + `identity` split (console C0) |
| `POST` | `/v1/skills/search` | Retrieval debug: scores |
| `POST` | `/v1/skills/{skill_id}/versions/{version}/promote` | Enqueue golden-gated promote (console C1) |
| `GET` | `/v1/proposals` · `POST` `/v1/proposals/{id}/decision` | Improvement-plane proposals |
| `GET` | `/v1/reviews` · `POST` `/v1/reviews/{decision_id}` | Alias of pending proposals until distill-review volume splits |
| `GET` | `/v1/jobs` · `POST` `/v1/jobs/{job}/run` | Improvement-plane job status and manual trigger (§20). HEX/compress remain gated (RW-6). |
| `POST` | `/v1/evals/runs` | Golden set against a library snapshot (eval firewall; no candidate writes) |
| `GET` | `/v1/facts` · `/v1/cases` · `/v1/affordances` | Tenant-scoped non-procedural memory reads |
| `POST` | `/v1/memory/query` | Federated retrieve debug across planes; does not start a run |
| `GET` | `/v1/policy` · `POST` `/v1/policy/proposals` | Read Policy (no secrets); T2 proposal only — does not apply |
| `GET` | `/v1/ledger/verify` | Verify the integrity chain (§21) |
| `GET` | `/v1/workspaces` · `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` | Registered workspaces (console) |
| `GET` | `/v1/me` · `POST` `/v1/auth/*` | Console session (dev login / OIDC). C5 tenant-switcher **UI** is not shipped. |
| `POST` | `/v1/goals/*` · `/v1/programs/*` · `/v1/templates` | Goal packs / programs (GP0–GP2) |

`POST /v1/runs` is **not** enqueue-only in sync mode: it drives the graph to a terminal (or error) before responding. Async mode returns 202 and streams via SSE.

Console-oriented behaviour is specified normatively in [`product-console.md`](product-console.md). **product-console.md wins on conflicts** for C0–C4.

### Aspirational (not implemented)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C5 UI | tenant switcher chrome | Phase-4 gate only ([remaining-work.md](remaining-work.md) RW-C5). APIs already isolate by `tenant_id`. |
| OG-11 | console model slug allowlist | Optional OR3: unknown slug on `POST /v1/runs` → 400; allowlist not in `console/static/` |

Error envelope (used on budget/in-flight `POST /v1/runs` and new remaining-work routes; FastAPI `{detail: ...}` MAY remain on `/health` and 422):

```json
{ "error": { "code": "budget_exhausted", "message": "...", "run_id": "01JD...", "retryable": false } }
```

## 10. CLI

### Implemented

```bash
recertia run --spec task.json [--runs-root .recertia] [--run-id ...] [--ablation]
recertia resume <run_id> [--runs-root .recertia] [--spec task.json]
recertia runs show <run_id> [--route-log]
recertia skills lint [--skills-root skills]
recertia skills search "dependency bump" --explain
recertia skills promote <skill_id> --version N --golden-dir PATH
# or: --golden-root PATH [--require-task-class-gate]
recertia ledger verify [--runs-root .recertia]
recertia lift --task-class repo-chore
recertia keys issue|revoke|list
recertia jobs run curator --dry-run
recertia jobs run practice
recertia jobs run recertify
recertia jobs run mine --hint "docs/runbook.md" --submit
recertia jobs run hex|compress   # no-op unless enablement predicates pass
recertia metrics --task-class repo-chore
recertia probes run --probes evals/probes/repo-chore.json
recertia eval run --task-class repo-chore
recertia policy
recertia memory query "dependency bump"
recertia backup [--root .recertia] [--output backups/recertia.tar.gz]
recertia restore backups/recertia.tar.gz --dest .recertia-restore
recertia tabletop <run_id> [--restore-from backups/recertia.tar.gz]
recertia canary [--live]
```

Policy is `policy/default.json` (`RECERTIA_POLICY_PATH`). `practice` without `--one-off`
prefers eligible failure clusters. `recertify` drains the lineage-revoke queue.
`metrics` preserves `unavailable` holes (PC-5). HEX/compress refuse without numeric
`practice_conversion` even if policy flags are true.

### Aspirational (not implemented)

```bash
recertia skills list [--task-class repo-chore] [--lifecycle candidate]
recertia skills show bump-python-dep@3
recertia review queue
recertia review approve <decision_id> --note "..."
recertia facts list --scope project
recertia cases show <case_id>
recertia proposals queue
recertia policy propose retrieval.min_score=0.60 --eval-compare
```

## 11. Metrics definitions

Precise definitions, because these numbers decide whether the system works:

| Metric | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `reuse_rate` | runs with `strategy ∈ {apply, adapt}` ÷ all runs, per task class |
| `first_attempt_success` | runs reaching `distill` with `attempt_no == 1` ÷ all runs |
| `attempts_to_success` | mean `attempt_no` at success; unsolved runs excluded but counted separately |
| `cost_per_solved_task` | Σ `spend.cost_usd` ÷ solved runs |
| `regression_rate` | golden tasks passing on version `N` but failing on `N+1` ÷ golden tasks |
| `retrieval_precision_at_3` | human-labelled applicable candidates in top 3 ÷ 3 |
| `library_yield` | approved skills with ≥1 later application ÷ all approved skills |

`library_yield` is the anti-vanity metric: it goes down when the library grows with
skills nobody reuses.

## 12. Observability

Every node emits a span with `run_id`, `node`, `attempt_no`, `route`, `reason`, and spend
delta. Required structured events: `run.started`, `retrieve.completed` (candidate ids +
scores), `plan.decided` (strategy + reason), `solve.attempt.finished`,
`validate.completed` (result vector), `distill.verdict`, `review.decided`,
`skill.version.written`, `run.finished`.

The `route_log` plus the transcript MUST be sufficient to reconstruct why a run behaved
as it did without re-running a model. Replayability is a hard requirement, not a
debugging nicety: it is what makes the eval harness trustworthy.

Additional required events for the expanded architecture: `criteria.locked` (hash + source),
`failure.classified` (class + evidence), `branch.selected` (winner + margin),
`fact.written`, `case.written`, `proposal.created` (job + kind), `recert.completed`,
`policy.changed` (tier + approver), `ledger.appended`.

Concurrency and merge events, required because a parallel run is otherwise unreadable after
the fact: `step.wave.started` (wave index + step ids + claims held), `resource.conflict`
(claim, blocking step, wait duration), `judge.context.opened` (criterion id + lens + inputs
hash, asserting the solver transcript was not attached), `merge.audited` (expected ids,
received ids, missing ids, action taken).
