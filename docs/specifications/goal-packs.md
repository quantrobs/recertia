# Recertia Specifications: Goal packs (migration programs)

Normative requirements for **Goal packs** / **migration programs**: ordered Goals for
large refactors. Complements [goal-objects.md](goal-objects.md). Decision:
[ADR-0014](../adr/0014-goal-packs-as-migration-programs.md).

**HTTP resource:** `/v1/programs` (`MigrationProgram` in `contracts/program.py`).  
**Product copy:** “Goal pack”. **Not** Tower `ReplayPack`.

**Non-goals:** mutating criteria after lock; intra-run fan-out as a substitute; Suggest
auto-lock; auto-advance between steps (deferred).

---

## GP-1 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Migration program** | Tenant-scoped linear program of Goal steps (`MigrationProgram`). |
| **Pack step** | One `MigrationStep` with a Goal, freeze/mutate hints, optional `external_handoff`. |
| **Handoff** | Continuity mode: `none` + external git metadata, `operator_workdir`, or `git_tip` (+ `repo_binding`). `copy_forward` deferred. |
| **Program bar** | Embedded `DesiredState` / `Constraint` lists merged into later steps at materialize. |
| **Freeze enforcement** | `advisory` (GP0 default) or `hard` (injects `must_not_modify` only when honest). |

---

## GP-2 Invariants (MUST)

1. Atomic lock unit is the **run** (ADR-0003 / ADR-0010).
2. AI propose / human apply; accept and bind are explicit.
3. Tenant isolation (PC-1).
4. Golden gate unchanged.
5. Step `succeeded` iff bound run terminal ∈ `acceptance_gate.terminal_in`.
6. **Honesty:** `freeze_enforcement=advisory` MUST NOT inject `must_not_modify`. UI/API MUST
   surface `freeze_advisory` when freeze_paths are set under advisory mode.
7. **GP0 execution:** creating/binding a run for a step with `handoff=none` REQUIRES
   `plan_only=true`, **or** a `workdir`, **and/or** populated `external_handoff`
   (branch / pr_url / sha). Empty fresh workspaces alone are insufficient.

---

## GP-3 Data model

See `contracts/program.py`. Summary:

### `MigrationProgram`

`program_id`, `tenant_id`, `title`, `intent`, `task_class`, `decomposition`, `status`,
`steps[]`, `program_bar_desired[]`, `program_bar_constraints[]`, `handoff`,
`freeze_enforcement` (default `advisory`), `repo_binding`, `budget`, `source`,
`disclaimer_acked_at`.

### `MigrationStep`

`step_id`, `ordinal` (unique, linear), `title`, `role`
(`characterization`|`structural`|`behaviour_lock`|`custom`), `goal`, `freeze_paths`,
`mutate_paths`, `acceptance_gate`, `status`, **`run_ids[]`**, **`current_run_id`**,
`criteria_preview_hash`, `external_handoff`, `goal_revision`.

Characterization is a **step role**, not a separate field list.

### Merge rules (program bar)

Append-by-id. Identical bodies for the same id are OK. Different bodies for the same id
MUST fail materialize (`MaterializeError`).

---

## GP-4 Lifecycle (linear)

```text
draft --accept--> active
  step planned -> ready when ordinal-1 succeeded|skipped (or ordinal==0)
  preview -> POST /v1/runs -> bind_run_id
  succeeded unlocks next; failed -> program blocked
  all required succeeded|skipped -> completed
```

Goal PATCH forbidden when step status ∈ `{queued, running, succeeded}`.  
Bind is **idempotent** for the same `run_id` / `idempotency_key`.

DAG `depends_on` is reserved; GP0 runtime ignores it and uses ordinal-1 only.

---

## GP-5 Stress codes

| Code | Severity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `freeze_advisory` | info | freeze_paths present under advisory enforcement |
| `freeze_mutate_overlap` | block | same path in freeze and mutate |
| `vacuous_command` | block | |
| `generic_pytest_only` | warn | |
| `weak_characterization` | warn | structural without prior characterization role |
| `program_bar_dropped` | warn | later step, empty program bar |
| `mega_goal` | warn | prefer program over one huge step |
| `no_hard_criteria` | block | |
| `missing_repo_binding` | block | `handoff=git_tip` without registered `repo_binding` |
| `missing_handoff` | warn | `copy_forward` deferred; use `git_tip` |

---

## GP-6 Workspace handoff

| Mode | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | **Shipped** — external git metadata and/or operator `workdir`; else `plan_only` |
| `operator_workdir` | **Shipped** — `workdir` required to execute |
| `copy_forward` | Deferred; prefer `git_tip` |
| `git_tip` | **Shipped (GP2)** — requires registered `repo_binding`; checkout tip into fresh workspace |

---

## GP-7 Budgets

`budget_from_goal_constraints` applies Goal `budget_ceiling` onto run `Budget` at preview /
materialize. Pack-level remaining budget fails closed on step run (**shipped** GP1).

## GP-9 Console

Pilot **Programs** board and Compose (suggest / save pack as program) **shipped** (#50).
GP2 tip SHA / binding status on the board may follow as a client polish.

---

## GP-10 Anti-patterns

- Advertising freeze as enforced under `advisory`
- Binding step N before N-1 succeeded
- Auto-advance
- Pack completion as skill promotion
- Whole-suite pytest as sole structural proof

---

## GP-11 Conformance (GP0)

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| GP-T1 | Accept creates zero runs |
| GP-T2 | Preview does not create runs / lock |
| GP-T3 | Bind records `run_ids` / `current_run_id`; linear gate |
| GP-T4 | Dependent step cannot bind while predecessor failed/pending |
| GP-T5 | Tenant isolation |
| GP-T6 | `freeze_mutate_overlap` blocks materialize |
| GP-T9 | `budget_ceiling` applied at materialize/preview |
| GP-T10 | Program bar appears in materialized later steps |

GP-T7/T8 (copy-forward / pack budget) are later milestones.

Covered by `tests/unit/test_migration_programs.py`.
