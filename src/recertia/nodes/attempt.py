"""Attempt-scoped spend accounting for ``solve`` (specs §10.1, §18).

``RunState.spent`` has exactly one writer: :class:`AttemptMeter`. Every solve path opens a
meter, charges what it uses, and commits once — so no path can execute work without charging
for it, and no path can forget a dimension.

The reason a meter is needed rather than direct reads of the runtime is lifetime mismatch.
``ModelClient.spend``, ``ToolRuntime.invocations`` and ``ClaimScheduler.conflicts`` are
*cumulative over the whole run*, while spend is charged *per attempt*. Reading a cumulative
counter as if it were an attempt delta charges every attempt for all preceding attempts too,
which compounds: four attempts of two tool calls each bill twenty. :class:`RuntimeWindow`
turns those counters into deltas, and the delta is what gets charged and persisted.

Charging is explicit rather than inferred from the runtime because ``ctx.op_once`` replays a
memoised result on resume without re-invoking the tool. An op that dispatched a tool call in
the original run must still be charged when its result is replayed, otherwise a resumed run
under-reports what it actually spent.
