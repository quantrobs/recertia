"""Pure Causal Skill Portfolio capacity controller (specs §24.1, ADR-0006, Phase 1).

Ranking, active-set selection, and negative-contribution retirement proposals, extracted
from :mod:`recertia.memory.procedural.active_set` as side-effect-free functions. Nothing
here touches the filesystem, a store, the clock, or the environment: the same inputs always
produce the same outputs, which is what makes the drop-in equivalence proof possible.

``PortfolioRankItem`` and ``RetirementProposal`` are internal / telemetry types. They are
**not** a second source of truth for active membership — ``SkillStatus.active`` remains the
only one (ADR-0007). Nothing in this module writes anything.

Two extension points are present but dormant in v1 (requirements FR-8, §3.7):

* ``rank_skills(..., score_fn=...)`` — a richer composite score (advantage-weighted
  influence, dependency coupling, a CoEvo-Mem-style learned residual, provenance prior).
* ``PortfolioRankItem.fidelity`` — a CrystalMem-style multi-fidelity / crystallization
  state ("liquid" / "glass" / "crystal").

Neither is used by production callers; they exist so that later elastic-memory work does
not require a breaking change to this interface.

    the bottom but never drops it. Nothing is filtered out — the returned list is always the

    ``config`` is accepted for interface stability and for future score functions that need
    thresholds; the default key does not read it.

    ``score_fn`` is an extension point that is unused in v1. When supplied, items are built
    with the default ``score`` first and then re-scored, so a score function may read the
    default composite. The ordering then uses that score as component 1 and keeps the same
