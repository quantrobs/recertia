"""Stable operation ids and at-least-once execution (M0; refactor-plan B6).

Every side-effecting call a node makes — a tool invocation, a ledger append — is keyed by
``(run_id, attempt_no, node, op_seq)``. Before performing the side effect, the caller checks
whether that key already has a recorded result; if so, it returns the stored result instead
of repeating the effect. This is what makes "kill the process mid-run and resume" safe: a
resumed run re-enters a node from its last checkpoint and may re-call the same operations, but
each one either no-ops (already applied) or runs exactly once (not yet applied) — never twice.
