"""Per-node checkpointing of ``RunState`` (M0).

Checkpointing after every node is what makes a run resumable at node granularity: killing the
process mid-run and restarting it re-reads the last saved ``(node, next_node, state)`` row and
continues from there, rather than replaying the whole run from ``intake``.
